## 📝 Additional Information

**Development Approach:**
- Started with project architecture and folder structure
- Implemented type definitions first for type safety
- Built reusable components before screens
- Used Context API for clean state management
- Focused on UI/UX polish and animations

**Technical Decisions:**
- Chose Expo for faster development and easier setup
